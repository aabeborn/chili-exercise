## Application start (dev mode)

To start the application in development mode, you can run: 
```bash
    npm run start
```

With this command you will start the react application and the json web server which contains the API used.

## Application start (prod mode)

to build and start the application in production mode, you can run this command:
```bash
    npm run production
```
It will dinamically generate and serve the build and starts the json web server. 


## Possible optimizations

-  Improve loading experience by using more loaders (for example during the images onLoad)
-  Divide APIs of the films list and the film's details one
-  Better error management using more than one ErrorBoundary
-  Put the logic inside a reusable component, an hook or in a coupond component

These above are possible improvements. It's an exercise so I have tried to made it as simple as possible. 
Also many more improvements could be made!!
